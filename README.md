Caravelo frontend engineer position
Assignment using Vue.js

To run the app in your computer locally please follow the steps:

1. open Visual Studio Code
2. open a terminal
3. write the command "npm install"
4. write the command "npm run serve"
5. open one of the links (localhost or ip address) in a web browser

For consideration in this project:
- This project uses font-awesome for icons. 
- This project uses Bootstrap for a quicker UI. 
- Vue router should be used if there were more than 1 page in this app. 
- Text should not be added directly to the HTML. One good alternative would be to use Vue I18n.
- It would be better to use a sass-loader such as scss for a better organization of the styles. 
- Even though it considers several cases, such as active and hover, the design could be improved in detail. 
- If the user closes the modal without making changes, no message is displayed. 
- When the user makes changes, the modal closes automatically. It also displays a message of success or error based on the random response of the httpstat.us/ (200 or 500).
